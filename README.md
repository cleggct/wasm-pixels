This project was the culmination of many scrapped prototypes exploring how to wire web assembly (in this case,
WASI components) with WebGL with the goal of providing a foundation for writing speedy graphics demos that
run in the browser.

Given that emscripten can basically let you do all of this (it supports not only OpenGL ES -> WebGL but also SDL2) the project has begun to seem a bit redundant to me, but it was a good learning experience as well as my
first foray into learning the Rust programming language. As such I'm going to shelve this project for now. But I figured I might as well throw it up on my github, maybe some day I'll feel motivated to do something with it.
